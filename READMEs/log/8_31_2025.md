# TLDR

High level steps of what I think is needed...

- Auth to GCP
- Create a GCP Pub/Sub Topic
- Set up a Google Cloud Function to act as the subscriber to the topic
- Publish to the Topic from the FastAPI

## How to auth to GCP

- gcloud auth login <!-- trigger auth flow from CLI to GCP -->
- gcloud config list <!-- Review gcloud CLI settings -->

## Create a GCP Pub/Sub Topic

- https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/create-topic
- Using the `gcloud pubsub topics create TOPIC_ID`
- ie: `gcloud pubsub topics create kb-ingest-topic`
- Verify topic was created: `https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topic/list`
